# Student-Grade-Analysis
This data analysis project examines student grades for a University course, using three datasets: students, assignments, and grades. The project begins by cleaning the data, ensuring there are no missing or duplicate records. Outliers are identified and assessed using boxplots and Z score, though they are found to be non-influential and are therefore ignored. The demographics of the students, including their levels and majors, are visualized to understand the distribution across different groups.

The project calculates final grades by combining scores from exams, quizzes, and homework, applying appropriate weights. Statistical analysis is conducted to determine if the grade distributions are normal, using Q-Q plots and the Shapiro-Wilk test. The results suggest that the data is not normally distributed. Hypothesis testing reveals a significant difference between the mean scores of freshmen and seniors, indicating that these groups have distinct performance levels.

Cluster analysis is performed using the K-Means algorithm, identifying four distinct student groups based on their grades, levels, and majors. This segmentation helps in understanding different performance patterns and can guide interventions to support lower-performing students. The project concludes with a summary of the findings and suggestions for future work, including the development of an automated reporting system for processing grades and generating insights across multiple courses.
